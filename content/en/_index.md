Established on December 10, 2020, the **Institute of Computing** originated from the former Department of Computer Science within the Institute of Mathematics. As a permanent unit of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), we are dedicated to advancing the field of computing through academic excellence.

The Institute is responsible for the Bachelor of Computer Science and the Graduate Program in Informatics (PPGI). Additionally, we provide essential computing education for various Engineering programs and other scientific disciplines, including Physics and Mathematics.

Located within the CCMN center (Block E), our facilities have various computer laboratories to support our academic environment, with additional research spaces and faculty offices integrated with the NCE and other areas of the campus.

Our mission encompasses teaching, research, technological innovation, and community outreach. We aim to drive national development through technology transfer while promoting digital inclusion and ethical professional growth.
